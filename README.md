# Development of Multi-Agent Control for Surface and Underwater Vehicles
The effective deployment of autonomous amphibious vehicles for surface and underwater operations re-
quires advancements in hardware, control systems, and decision-making algorithms to operate efficiently
across dynamic environments. Current systems often lack seamless state estimation, multi-agent coor-
dination, and adaptive control strategies for real-time obstacle avoidance in diverse operational settings.
To achieve robust and adaptable performance, there is a need for a unified framework that integrates
priority-based task assignment, state-aware control switching, and flexible leader-follower dynamics for
collaborative operations among surface and underwater agents. The effective deployment of autonomous

Implementation Scheme
• Modeling: Begin by developing accurate mathematical models for both surface and underwater  dynamics of your vehicles.
• Simulation: Utilize simulation environments (like MATLAB/Simulink, Gazebo, or ROS) to test control strategies in virtual scenarios before deploying on actual vehicles.
• Hardware Integration: Once simulations yield satisfactory results, implement the control strategies
on the physical vehicles, ensuring to integrate with sensors and actuators for real-time feedback.
• Testing and Validation: Conduct extensive testing in controlled environments, gradually introducing
complexity (e.g., obstacles, varying terrains) to validate the robustness of the control strategies.
